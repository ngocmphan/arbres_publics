      <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>The topic of the project is exploring the greenery of the Greater Montreal Area with public trees to inform the public about the changes in trees and green scenery.</p>

      <h2>Project goal</h2>
            <p>Based on the fact that each individual needs on average seven or
            eight trees for air and 3-5% of trees die each year,
            we are assessing the number of public trees in Montreal against the
            number of residents currently living on Montreal Island.
            The project aims to determine if the number of trees are appropriate
            for the current population living in Montreal.
            In addition, exploration regarding the wellness and diversity of the trees planted is conducted.</p>

      <h2>Data Sources and variables </h2>
      <p> The data set obtained from Ville de Montreal with information regarding public trees.
            The data set included 22 variables with maximum of 317,844 observations with a time period from 1989 to current year.
            The dataset was made available to the public on July 2012.
            The data set has missing observations for 12 variables.
            In addition, the data source disclosed that some geolocation and other information in the system might not be precise or up-to-date for some trees.  </p>
